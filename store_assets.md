HOW IT WORKS:
1. Click the extension icon in your toolbar
2. Enter the website name or purpose for the email address
3. Select how many messages the address should accept
4. Copy the generated address or use it directly in forms
5. Receive forwarded messages to your real inbox until the limit is reached

WHY USE THIS EXTENSION?
• Protect your primary email address from spam
• Create trackable addresses to see who sells your data
• Set limits on how many emails each address can receive
• Keep your inbox organized by easily identifying sources
• Simple and quick to use while browsing
