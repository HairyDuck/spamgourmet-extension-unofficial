## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how the unofficial Spamgourmet Email Generator Chrome extension (referred to as "the Extension") collects, uses, and discloses information from its users. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using our extension.

## Information Collection and Use

### What We Collect

The Extension collects and stores the following information locally on your device:

* Generated email addresses

This information is stored using Chrome's built-in storage API and is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties except as described below.

### Communication with Spamgourmet

The Extension communicates with the Spamgourmet service (www.spamgourmet.com) solely for the purpose of verifying account information and generating valid email addresses. No browsing history or other personal data is sent to Spamgourmet beyond what is necessary for the Extension's core functionality.

### No Tracking or Analytics

The Extension does not use any tracking technologies, analytics services, or cookies to collect information about your browsing activity.

## Data Storage

All user preferences and generated email history are stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This data remains on your device and is not synchronized or backed up to external servers.

You can clear this stored data at any time by:
1. Right-clicking on the Extension icon
2. Selecting "Options"
3. Clicking the "Clear Data" button in the settings

## Third-Party Services

The Extension interacts only with the Spamgourmet service to generate email addresses. As this is an unofficial extension, we have no control over the Spamgourmet service or its policies. Please refer to Spamgourmet's own privacy policy for information about how they handle your data: https://www.spamgourmet.com/privacy

## Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information. However, please note that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the Extension's description on the Chrome Web Store. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
